# The Techno Political

I have started this project in order to look at the Indian Political Space from the eyes of Artificial Intelligence. As a first, I have tried to predict the election result of more than 300 State Assembly Elections held in India till date, the Dataset for which is contained in ElectionData.csv and Python Code in election_analysis.py

- It took me few weeks to make the Dataset ElectionData.csv, I went through the sites of ECI, web scraped Wikipedia pages and made other efforts as well, so if someone is willing to use this Dataset, please give due credit. 

- Also, I want to expand this project to a level where it will be possible to predict the winning probability of a candidate in a constituency (assembly and parliamentary). So if someone is interested in collaborating, feel free to write me at imaanandaaditya@outlook.com
